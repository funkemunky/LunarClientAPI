# LunarClientAPI
Release of AgentManny's public LunarClientAPI with increased compatibility. Compatible with versions v1.7.10-v1.12.2.

## Information
For 1.7.10, this plugin can run without dependencies. However, for 1.8.X-1.12.2 compatibility, this will require [Atlas](https://github.com/funkemunky/Atlas) *(v1.8.2 or newer)* or [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) *(whichever version is compatible with your server)*.

If you have Atlas or ProtocolLib on your server, LunarClientAPI will always default to Atlas first, then ProtocolLib. This includes servers using a 1.7.10 based Bukkit.
